# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

**Im feeling semi-confident in the process. I spent a good amount of time understanding the For statement and interpreting what it does going from our initialization, condition  and into our final expression. I really got more insight into reading and deciphering what a For statement is doing when it begins to loop.**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**It feels to great to have a a somewhat better understanding on this subject and being able to crossover different segments into this one. Im still grasping the order in which i implement these processes within a for statement. But i feel a bit more confident now that i actually know how to decipher and read out these processes and what there actually trying to do. Im getting the hang of proper syntax within combining processess but still need some work on translating into code.**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**I still need to learn implementing methods within the for statement and being able to manipulate it for different outcomes now that i have the formula down.I feel proper syntax and better understnding will help me practice these more.Im right on the verge of getting it, but still having some questions come up.Im gonna put aside some time after our segment 4 work these next two days and buckle down on practicing for statements with different methods. I have a good and flexible calender system in place to help me rearrange my time.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

** Im still trying to learn how to manipulate the final expression on certain questions to give me the proper output im looking for. I want to work more with For statements and intergrating if statements and other methods to give me the proper outcomes. Just need to see more examples and successful run throughs with code to better perfect this.
